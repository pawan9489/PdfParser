ToDo:
1. Upload pdf with some random pdf
2. Create Modals & Store Data - Done
3. Store KeyWords, Types, Structures - Done
4. Add Annotations as PDF templates - Done
5. Select existing PDF templates
6. Cache the pages read
7. Annotations must create a Rough Sketch
8. Create Excel templates
9. Write to Excel & Download
10. When deleted annotation it must delete the corresponding template item & vice versa

Throw Error If
    1. Same KeyWords for Annotations
    2. Running process without any Excel templates
    3. Running process with Unkonwn Excel Columns which are not selected in annotations
    4. Running process with no annotations selected 
    5. Adding anything new to structures
    6. Can only create a type using String, Number.x & also '-' separated
    7. Template with no Sheet Name

Mostly maintain annotations in 3 ways
    Single Value - Ex: NI, Total Salary
    Key value pair - Ex: Tax Code: 1033L
    Grid : Ex: Earnings, Deductions

Known Problems: 
    Tax Codes are unable to read since picking up blob of text and the box size is not even half of blob.
    Cannot Separate types like String - Number.x - String
